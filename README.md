# Morning Manager

Morning Manager is an iOS application that's designed to be used to manage your day when you wake up in the morning. 

## Goals

The fundamental goals of this app were achieved by including a weather forecast and the ability to view your calendar events in a format that's easy to understand even while groggy.

## Technologies

This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API, EventKit for calendar events, as well as UserDefaults for data persistence.

## Instructions

To run this app, you must [obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/home/sign_up) and enter your specific key in fetchWeather() in ViewController.swift. You must allow the app to access your Calendar (your experience will be different depending on the Calendar events you have). You will also need all the icons in the folder (as well as the app icon) for the application to properly run.

## Potential Updates

Potential updates for this app include a UICollectionView to enable the user to horizontally scroll through multiple time options, the ability to choose your preferred temperature reading (Farenheight or Celcius), and connecting a DetailViewController to view more information about a given event.
